```{r Load your workspace}
library(ISLR)
attach(Smarket)
```

```{r Look at your data set}
names(Smarket)
dim(Smarket)
summary(Smarket) # overview
cor(Smarket[,-9]) # Make a pairwise correlation matrix of all predictors in the data
```

```{r Logistic Regression Model}
### used to predict `Direction` (qual.) using the quant. predictors
glm.fit=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume,data=Smarket,family=binomial) # `glm` is generalize linear models
# family=binomial tells the function to apply logistic regression

summary(glm.fit)
```

```{r Apply the predict() function}
### apply predict() function to get prob. of the response (X)
glm.probs=predict(glm.fit,type="response")# General:default P(Y=1|X)
glm.probs[1:10]
contrasts(Direction)

glm.pred=rep("Down",1250) # create a repeat vector "Down" to be used later
glm.pred[glm.probs > .5] = "Up" # Classify either prob as up or down based on threshold
```

```{r Confusion Matrix}
table(glm.pred, Direction) # determine how many were correctly or incorrectly classified
```
